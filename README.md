# ehr-azure-workbench
Spinoff application for MTX Hackolympics

### Team DataHolic

We explored various blockchain technologies during the competition, EHR is one of our experiments with solidity based smart contracts. 
We have tried to create end-to-end contract for medical health records ledger, and this contract is deployed on the Azure Workbench Services. Azure workbench allows us to create the web API just by submitting the smart contracts and workflow as input. 

Please access the workbench API from [here](https://ehr-nrsseu.azurewebsites.net/applications/1/workflows/1). You will need access approval, please send me your email ID at pranavpawar3@gmail.com to access the API.
